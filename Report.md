# HW-MINI-PROJECT-2022-Ibrahim-Albloushi-

For our HW mini project, we had to edit code that would be implemented on the RaspberryPie Pico that’s main function is to control the LED on the pico. The .c file was written such that the LED would flash on and off while fading between low and high intensities. It’s a uniform oscillation between low and high. 

The goal was to edit the script such that the LED pattern is changed from its uniform blinking setting. Our team decided to create a pattern that begins similarly to how the regular pattern was but as time went on we wanted the pattern to change then be reset again and loop this way. The change we decided to apply was to create gradual change from soft blinking to more abrupt blinking at faster speeds, then for it to reset and start over after a certain period. The idea is to build a looping suspense blink. 

This was achieved by creating a new variable called “change” (line 19) which would increment with each cycle of blinking by 20 (line 37). In the if statement there are limits to the keep the fade value within the max and min values of the led brightness (line 28), the change variable acts as a decrement for the upper limit of the LED brightness, so with every blink the max value the LED brightness can reach decreases. The element that makes the flash occur abruptly after a couple of cycles is that as the change variable increases, as a result the max brightness limit decreases, so the LED barely increases in brightness once the change value is maximized, but if that was just the case nothing abrupt would happen only less brightness with each blink, the abrupt blinking occurs because after every cycle the fade variable is equated to the MAX_LED_BRIGHTNESS variable which makes the later blinks jump up to 255 from a much smaller value. Line 29 in the script is responsible for this abrupt change in brightness. Then to reset the cycle we have added another if statement at the beginning that checks the value of “change” and once that value of change reaches MAX_LED_BRIGHTNESS (255) the value of change is reset again. It takes 13 blinks for the cycle to restart because initially change=10 and increments by 20 each blink. 

Overall we did get the results desired, and the LED acted exactly as expected, the cycle period can be varied by changing the increment of "chnage".
